	<h1>Hello everyone</h1>
	<h2> My name is Sanjida Akter Trisha</h2>
	<h3>Certified Web Designer and Wordpress expert</h3>

	<p>Greetings, I’m Sanjida akter. I’m a web developer living in Bangladesh. I am a fan of design, web development, and entrepreneurship. I’m also interested in technology and programming. </p>

	<p>It should also include a tech table that lists all of the software and tools that the candidate is experienced in using for web design. Common software and web development tools include NetSuite, Node.js, HTML, CSS, C#, JavaScript, Git Hub, Bootstrap, Gulp, Handlebars, Bit Bucket, Drupal, SEO, UI/UX, and Python. Using a two- or three-column table allows you to include several applications in a limited amount of space.</p>

	<h1>Using Industry-Specific Keywords</h1>
	<p>Web developer resumes also need to incorporate as many industry-specific keywords as possible in order to be ranked highly by the sophisticated applicant tracking systems that companies often now employ to review incoming job applications. If a resume and its accompanying cover letter fail to use the keywords that these systems are programmed to identify, it may be well be doomed never to reach the human eye of a hiring manager.</p>
	<p>The best guide to knowing which keywords to use is the language used in the job advertisement to which you are applying. Keyword phrases that are frequently used in postings for web developers include:</p>
